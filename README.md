# To_Do_List
A to-do list is a simple and effective tool used for task management and organization. 
It helps individuals keep track of tasks, appointments, and goals.
Users can create a list of tasks they need to complete, often accompanied by due dates or priorities. 
This list can be digital or on paper, and it serves as a visual reminder of what needs to be done.
